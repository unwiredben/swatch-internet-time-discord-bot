This is a simple Discord.js bot to implement a /beat command for the NYC Resistor Discord server.
We've had this command on our internal Slack instance forever and use it to get the start and end times
for meetings, so now that we're moving to Discord, it seemed like an easy task to get this running
over there.

It's heavily based on the excellent (discord.js tutorial)[https://discordjs.guide/].

To use, you need a .env file that defines TOKEN, CLIENTID, and GUILDID variables.
